Accessibility template for Joomla! sites
========================================

by [Andrey Novikov](https://github.com/AndNovAtor)

## Using codes/libraries/frameworks

This template use [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) and [JQuery](http://jquery.com).
Css an js files are stored and used locally.
## Browser and device support
Modern browser (including Edge) - _full_ support.
IE support - versions >= 9.

Support all last version of _modern_ browser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Edge, ..), as I _test_ (:grin:).
It also has partial support of IE: in IE 10/11, as I know, only grayscale doesn't work (IE 10/11 doesn't support filters), other styles works same.
In IE 9 filters is enabled (by _its own way_), but some styles work different (_of course_ :smirk:); fortunately, js and many styles work correctly - so, template is displayed _normally_.
In IE 8 template work wrong (btw, however, js for additional panel of template settings toolbar and js for additional panel elements work correctly).
